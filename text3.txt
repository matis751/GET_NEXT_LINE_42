DRACULA   YYY
_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at   YYY
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an   YYY
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I   YYY
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the   YYY
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived   YYY
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The   YYY
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the   YYY
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is   YYY
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish   YYY
rule.   YYY

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.   YYY
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or   YYY
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was   YYY
very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the   YYY
waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a   YYY
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the   YYY
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I   YYY
don't know how I should be able to get on without it.   YYY
