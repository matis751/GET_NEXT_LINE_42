The Lord of the Rings is now issued in a new edition, and the      ZZZ
opportunity has been taken of revising it. A number of errors and      ZZZ
inconsistencies that still remained in the text have been corrected, and an      ZZZ
attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive      ZZZ 
readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and      ZZZ
if some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed to      ZZZ
keep my notes in order; but many enquiries could only be answered by      ZZZ
additional appendices, or indeed by the production of an accessory volume      ZZZ
containing much of the material that I did not include in the original      ZZZ
edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime      ZZZ
this edition offers this Foreword, an addition to the Prologue, some notes,      ZZZ
and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in intention      ZZZ
complete in items but not in references, since for the present purpose it      ZZZ
has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of      ZZZ
the material prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the      ZZZ
accessory volume.      ZZZ
